                    <dt>Slowness as a feature, seriously?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Well, not so seriously 🤪
                        <br>
                        It's more of a commentary on today's always-online culture. But we do plan to use this service ourselves when traveling.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>What happens to my data after delivery?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        We pay for hosting ourselves, so we don't want to keep data if we don't have to.
                        <br>
                        The postcard is stored in a database and erased as soon as it is successfully sent.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Is my data encrypted?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        It is encrypted in transit (this website uses HTTPS). It is however not encrypted end-to-end, just like most emails and just like a real postcard.
                        <br>
                        So don't send classified top-secret messages through here :)
                    </dd>

                    <dt>The website gets slower when I submit multiple postcards.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is by design: to protect against SPAM, the website requires the client (your browser) to compute a lot of numbers. The difficulty of that computation rises for each letter send in quick succession.
                        <br>
                        This is to prevent bad actors sending a lot of letters very quickly.
                        <br>
                        Basically, you should be able to send 1-3 letters per day without waiting more than 10 seconds at this step.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Where do I actually send the letters?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This service is invite-only for now: the link to send messages is added to every message sent through the service.
                        <br>

                    <dt>Where is the code?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The backend and frontend are open-source and available on a <a href="https://github.com/narvalotech/lazypost/">GitHub repository</a>.
